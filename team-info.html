        Who are we?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Team code-ium is a team based in the New Jersey-New York tristate area, hoping to raise awareness and address mental health in the 21st century, particularly focusing on 
        the intersection of depression and other mental health disorders with loneliness. 
        <br>
        Loneliness and its effects are most often noticed on the elderly. Social isolation and loneliness play a role in mortality rates, age expectancy, and overall quality of life, 
        contributing to such disorders as depression, irregardless of demographic factors, baseline health, and even mobility.
        <br>
        However, while the issue has gone largely unnoticed until now, loneliness and social isolation have become more present ever since the rise of COVID 19 and the global pandemic. 
        The pandemic limited our abilities to interact with friends, thus launching its own pandemic of mental health crises and disorders among peoples of all ages and sexes.

        Our Mission: Take a Walk!
    </h2>
    <p>
        To truly address loneliness, we looked to shared experiences during the pandemic. While safe alternatives were quickly implemented at the onset of the pandemic, like Zoom or Discord,
        we shared discontent for the applications; sure, they were great, but something still felt less personal. We critically examined what we felt constituted true social interaction and
        connection, outreaching even to family members to get their perspectives.
        <br>
        Our solution thus became walking; over the course of the pandemic, walking outside was one of the few safe ways to go outdoors and interact with others, face to face. We designed
        "Take a Walk!" to closely mimic the action of walking with others, particularly with the ability to see other people's faces and the routes they choose to walk.
